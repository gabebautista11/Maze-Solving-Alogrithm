# Maze-Solving-Alogrithm

I am still working on this project! So far I gave the user the ability to draw on the maze.

Things I need to do:
1. Convert maze data into Graph.
2. Write a shortest path algorithm to start at the start of the maze and reach the end.
3. display what the alogrithm is using while it is doing it.
